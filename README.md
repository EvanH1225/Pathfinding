# Pathfinding

This is a maze building and pathfinding algorithm visualization. With this I implemented a recursive backtracking algorithm and prim's algorithm
to generate two types of mazes in different ways. These mazes can be generated from a starting point if one is set and an ending point can be
set before or after a maze has been generated.

To solve the maze, a breadth-first search and depth-first search algorithm can be used. As the algorithms go along, where they have searched and
where they need to search will be visible to and the final path will be shown one the correct path is found.

P.S. I apologize in advance for the zero comments throughout the code
